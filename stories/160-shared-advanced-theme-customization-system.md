# Story 160: Shared Advanced Theme Customization System

## Story Statement
As a **User in any role**, I want to **have an advanced theme customization system that allows personalization of the interface while maintaining accessibility and consistency**, so that **I can work in an environment that suits my preferences and needs while ensuring a cohesive user experience across the platform**.

## Feature Details

### Dynamic Theme Engine
- **Ant Design Theme Algorithm**: Leverage Ant Design v5's theme algorithm system
- **Role-Based Themes**: Default color schemes using Ant Design tokens for each user role (Professor, Student, Secretary, Leader)
- **Personal Customization**: Individual color, font, and layout preferences through design tokens
- **Accessibility Themes**: High contrast using Ant Design's compact/dark algorithms, colorblind-friendly options
- **Seasonal Themes**: Optional seasonal variations using theme presets
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview using Ant Design's dynamic theme switching

### Advanced Customization Options
- **Color Palette Editor**: Custom color selection using Ant Design's colorPrimary and seed color generation
- **Typography Controls**: Font size and weight using Ant Design's fontSize and fontWeight tokens
- **Layout Density**: Compact, standard, and spacious using Ant Design's size tokens
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic and manual switching using defaultAlgorithm and darkAlgorithm
- **Component Styling**: Component-level token customization through ConfigProvider

## Acceptance Criteria

### Theme Selection Interface
- [ ] Users can access theme customization from profile settings
- [ ] Role-based default themes are automatically applied based on user role
- [ ] Real-time preview shows changes as user modifies settings
- [ ] Quick theme switching between predefined themes
- [ ] Import/export capability for sharing custom themes

### Customization Controls
- [ ] Color picker with accessibility validation ensures proper contrast ratios
- [ ] Typography settings include web-safe fonts and size scaling options
- [ ] Layout density affects spacing, padding, and information density
- [ ] Dark mode includes true dark theme and automatic switching based on system preferences
- [ ] Component-level customization preserves overall design consistency

### Accessibility and Compliance
- [ ] All custom themes automatically meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Colorblind simulation helps users test theme accessibility
- [ ] High contrast themes available for vision-impaired users
- [ ] Font scaling supports users with different vision needs

## Technical Considerations

### Theme Architecture
- **Ant Design Design Tokens**: Use Ant Design v5's token system for dynamic theming
- **ConfigProvider**: Centralized theme configuration through Ant Design's ConfigProvider
- **Theme Algorithms**: Leverage built-in algorithms (default, dark, compact) for theme variations
- **Component Theming**: Consistent theming across all Ant Design components
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient theme switching with Ant Design's CSS-in-JS solution
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ant Design's built-in cross-browser support

### User Preferences
- **Persistent Storage**: User theme preferences saved across sessions
- **Cloud Sync**: Theme settings synchronized across devices for same user
- **Default Fallbacks**: Graceful fallback to default themes if custom themes fail
- **Migration Support**: Smooth migration when theme system is updated

## UI/UX Requirements

### Customization Interface
- **Visual Editor**: Intuitive interface for non-technical users to customize themes
- **Advanced Controls**: Power user options for detailed customization

## Dependencies
- Story 001: User Authentication (user preference storage)
- Story 003: Shared Navigation System (component theming)
- Story 007: User Profile Management (preference management)
- Story 088: Shared Accessibility Compliance System (accessibility validation)


## Status
**Status:** unfinished  
**Implementation Date:** TBD  
**Notes:** To be implemented
## Success Metrics
- **Customization Usage**: 60% of users modify at least one theme setting
- **Accessibility Compliance**: 100% of custom themes meet accessibility standards
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.6+ rating on interface customization survey
- **Performance Impact**: <100ms additional load time for custom themes

## Priority
Medium - Enhances user experience but not critical for core functionality

## Estimated Effort
Medium (6-8 weeks) - Requires careful architecture for maintainable theming system
