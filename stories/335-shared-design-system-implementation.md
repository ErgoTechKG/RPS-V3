# Story 335: Shared Design System Implementation and Management

## Title
Shared Design System Implementation with Component Library Management

## Role
Shared

## Category
UI/UX Foundation

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement a comprehensive design system using Ant Design as the primary UI framework, providing consistent visual language, component libraries, accessibility standards, and theme management across the entire research management platform. The system ensures visual consistency, development efficiency, and scalable user experience design through Ant Design's ConfigProvider and design token system.

## User Story
As a developer and designer, I want a comprehensive design system based on Ant Design with standardized components and theme configuration so that I can build consistent, accessible, and maintainable user interfaces across all platform features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Design System Foundation
- [ ] Ant Design ConfigProvider implementation in App.jsx:
  - Configure global theme with custom design tokens
  - Set up role-based theme switching mechanism
  - Configure Chinese locale settings
- [ ] Complete color palette implementation using Ant Design tokens:
  - Primary brand colors (Brand Blue #1A73E8, Academic Purple #7C4DFF)
  - Functional colors mapped to Ant Design's colorSuccess, colorWarning, colorError, colorInfo
  - Role-specific color themes (Professor Blue, Student Green, Secretary Purple, Leader Gold)
  - Neutral colors using Ant Design's gray scale with accessibility-compliant contrast ratios
- [ ] Typography system configuration:
  - Configure Ant Design theme with Chinese font priority (Source Han Sans, PingFang SC)
  - Set up heading hierarchy using Ant Design Typography component
  - Configure font sizes using Ant Design's token system
  - Font weight specifications using Ant Design's fontWeight tokens

### Component Library
- [ ] Migrate existing custom CSS components to Ant Design components:
  - Replace custom buttons with Ant Design Button component
  - Use Ant Design Form components with built-in validation
  - Implement Ant Design Card component with customized styles
  - Use Ant Design Menu for navigation with responsive behavior
  - Replace custom modals with Ant Design Modal
- [ ] Configure Ant Design data display components:
  - Use Ant Design Table with built-in sorting, filtering, and pagination
  - Integrate Ant Design Charts or maintain existing chart library with theme consistency
  - Use Ant Design Badge and Tag components for status indicators
  - Implement Ant Design Progress and Spin components for loading states

### Spacing and Layout System
- [ ] Use Ant Design's spacing system based on design tokens:
  - Configure marginXS, marginSM, marginMD, marginLG tokens
  - Set up paddingXS, paddingSM, paddingMD, paddingLG tokens
  - Align with Ant Design's 8px base unit system
- [ ] Implement Ant Design Layout components:
  - Use Layout, Header, Content, Footer, Sider components
  - Configure Grid and Row/Col components for responsive layouts
  - Set up Space component for consistent spacing
- [ ] Configure Ant Design breakpoints to match design requirements:
  - Customize breakpoints if needed (default: xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)

### Accessibility Implementation
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- [ ] Color contrast ratio validation (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support with proper focus indicators
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility with ARIA attributes
- [ ] Alternative text for all images and icons
- [ ] Font scaling support up to 200%

### Theme Management System
- [ ] Ant Design theme configuration:
  - Set up theme algorithm for light/dark mode switching
  - Configure design tokens in ConfigProvider
  - Create role-based theme configurations using theme.algorithm
- [ ] Implement theme switching mechanism:
  - Create theme context for dynamic switching
  - Support light/dark modes using Ant Design's defaultAlgorithm and darkAlgorithm
  - Implement role-based theme variations (Professor, Student, Secretary, Leader)
- [ ] Theme persistence and application:
  - Store user theme preference in localStorage
  - Apply theme on app initialization
  - Ensure smooth theme transitions without page reload

### Documentation and Tools
- [ ] Interactive component documentation with code examples
- [ ] Design token documentation with usage guidelines
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines and testing checklists
- [ ] Implementation examples for common patterns
- [ ] Figma/Sketch design file synchronization

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Implementation
- Ant Design v5.x with ConfigProvider for global theme configuration
- React components utilizing Ant Design component library
- Design tokens configured through Ant Design's theme system
- Storybook integration for Ant Design component documentation
- Migration path from existing CSS to Ant Design components

### Build System
- Design token compilation from source files
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Visual regression testing for component consistency
- Bundle optimization for production deployment

### Documentation Platform
- Interactive component playground
- Design system website with search functionality
- Version control for design system updates
- Integration with development workflow

### Quality Assurance
- Automated accessibility testing with axe-core
- Visual regression testing with Percy or similar
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring for component rendering

## Dependencies
- 001 (User Authentication)
- 003 (Shared Navigation System)
- 079 (Shared Design System Management)
- 088 (Shared Accessibility Compliance System)


## Status
**Status:** unfinished  
**Implementation Date:** TBD  
**Notes:** To be implemented
## Estimated Effort
Extra Large (15-25 story points)

## Notes
This story implements a comprehensive design system using Ant Design as the primary UI framework. The implementation includes:

1. **ConfigProvider Setup**: Global theme configuration in App.jsx with custom design tokens
2. **Migration Strategy**: Gradual migration from custom CSS components to Ant Design components
3. **Role-Based Themes**: Four distinct theme variations for different user roles
4. **Design Tokens**: Leveraging Ant Design's token system for consistent styling
5. **Accessibility**: Built-in WCAG compliance through Ant Design components

The implementation follows the professional, academic design principles with proper accessibility support and scalable architecture for future expansion.
